Financial Risk</a>
</h1>

<P>
As a rule the ACME Corporation clients pay within 30 days from shipment. Nevertheless,
there is the risk that a client may be unable to fulfill its responsibility.
The ACME Corporation transfered this risk to a financial insurance company that
covers the responsibility of each customer up to a certain debt ceiling, depending
on the customer financial record.  

<P>
In order not to displease its clients the policy of the ACME Corporation is
to continue selling to a client after reaching the debt ceiling imposed by the
financial insurance company. In this case the risk above the debt ceiling is
assumed by the ACME Corporation. 

<P>
The CEO of the ACME Corporation has to decide if the client's debt ceiling needs
to be renegotiated with the financial insurance company. For that she wants
to know what percentage of the client's debt is not being covered by the insurance
company in the present deal.  

<P>
The ACME Financial Department came up with a formula to measure a client risk.
Consider the step function <IMG

time <IMG

The risk associated with a debt is the area defined by function and the x axis,
i.e. the risk between time <IMG

 ALT="\( t_{0} \)"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

Considering that each client <IMG

 ALT="\( c \)"> has a debt ceiling <IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 ALT="\( L_{c} \)"> the uncovered
risk is just the area above the debt ceiling that can be defined as the integral

Thus, the percentage of uncovered risk for all clients is quotient of the sum
of all uncovered risks by the sum of all risks, as given by the following formula:

<P>
You where was asked to write a program to compute the percentage of uncovered
risk in the last fiscal year, using the formula above and the data provided
by a listing of the ACME's ERP.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00011000000000000000">
Input description</a>
</h2>

<P>
The listing you will use as input starts with the number of clients with sales
in the last fiscal year. For each client the first line has the debt limit and
the number of sales. In the following lines, one for each sale, there is the
sale's value, the day of the year of the invoice and the day of the year of
the receipt. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00012000000000000000">
Output description</a>
</h2>

<P>
You program must write the percentage of uncovered risk, truncated to 2 fractional
digits.

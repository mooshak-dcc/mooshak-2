	Default configurations of Mooshak 2.0.
	
	These defaults are meant for debugging only.
	
	A similar file is automatically created in the servlet container,
	under the parent directory of Mooshak's webapp.
	
	The file is named  "MooshakProperties.xml"
	and is initialized with default values adjusted to the server.
